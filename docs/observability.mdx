# Observability for Parca

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

Parca supports four pillars of Observability. Monitoring, Logging, Tracing, and Profiling.

## Profiling

Parca by default scrapes its own pprof endpoints on [localhost:7070/debug/pprof](http://localhost:7070/debug/pprof).
The different types of profiles are available via Parca's UI.

## Logging

Parca logs are structured by default. Parca's log level can be configured with `--log-level="info"`.

## Tracing

Parca has tracing for some of its functionality. You can configure the OpenTelemetry collector with `--otlp-address=STRING`.

For a local setup with Jaeger check [scripts/local-tracing/](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca/tree/main/scripts/local-tracing).

## Monitoring

Parca exposes Prometheus metrics on [localhost:7070/metrics](http://localhost:7070/metrics).

Parca's monitoring is mostly focused on read and write requests to Parca.
For that reason the `grpc_server_handled_total` is the most important metric for Parca and most of the other metrics and helpful for debugging overall.

There are some FrostDB specific metrics that are useful to monitor as well.

| Metric                      |  Description                                                |  Type     |
| ----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `frostdb_granules_compactions_total`| Number of per table compaction events that have occurred.   | counter   |
| `frostdb_granules_created_total`    | Number of per table granules that have been created.        | counter   |
| `frostdb_blocks_rotated_total`      | Number of per table blocks that have rotated out.           | counter   |
| `frostdb_active_table_block_size`   | The estimated size in bytes of each tables active block size.  | gauge     |
| `frostdb_row_insert_size`           | Per table tracking of the size in bytes of rows inserted.   | histogram |
| `frostdb_thanos_objstore_bucket_last_successful_upload_time`| If bucket storage is enabled, the last successful upload to the bucket. | gauge |
| `frostdb_thanos_objstore_bucket_operation_failures_total`   | Total number of bucket operations that have failed. | counter |
| `frostdb_tx_high_watermark`         | The transaction number that is safe to read up to.          | gauge     |


### Service Level Objectives

Here are some example Service Level Objectives for Parca.

| Availability    | The proportion of successful Query Labels requests to Parca, as measured by Parca's gRPC interceptor. | 99% in 2w                        |
| Latency         | The proportion of sufficiently fast Query Labels requests handled by Parca, as measured by Parca's gRPC metrics interceptor. | 95% of requests in < 100ms in 2w |

Parca considers gRPC codes `Aborted, Unavailable, Internal, Unknown, Unimplemented, DataLoss` as errors. Every other gRPC code is considered successful.

#### Pyrra

Parca contains [Service Level Objective files](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca/tree/main/deploy/pyrra) for [Pyrra](https://github.com/pyrra-dev/pyrra). Pyrra will setup alerting based on the given SLOs and contains a UI for the most important aspects of these SLOs.

### Grafana Dashboard

Parca ships with a [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca/blob/main/deploy/grafana/parca.json) that gives a good overview of Parca's state and should be a good entry point when troubleshooting.
This dashboard should follow the above-given SLOs for Parca.
