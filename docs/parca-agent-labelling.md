# Labels

This page provides a comprehensive reference for all labels supported by the Parca Agent, categorized for easy navigation. The labels include essential system, process, thread, Kubernetes, container, and agent metadata attached to profiling data. 
These labels can be used as-is or customized through [Prometheus relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) to enhance profiling insights and debugging efficiency.
The relabeling config can be passed to the agent via the `--config-path` flag. 

### **Always present labels**

| **node**  | The name of the node that the process is running on as specified by the `--node` flag. |

## Configuration

Parca Agent supports relabeling in the same fashion as Prometheus.
This can be used to add, update, or delete labels, as well as filtering the profiles sent to Parca (keep or drop).

To do so, pass a YAML configuration file to the agent with `--config-path` (default: `parca-agent.yaml`) with a list of `relabel_configs`.
Example:

```yaml
relabel_configs:
# Example: Add a profiler_pid label (e.g. provider_pid="cpu/1234")
- source_labels: [__name__, pid]
  separator: /
  target_label: profiler_pid
  regex: parca_agent_(.+)
  replacement: $1
  action: replace
```

Please see the [Prometheus `relabel_config` documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) for more details about the fields.
