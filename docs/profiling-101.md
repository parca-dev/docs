# CPU Profiling

Understand basics of CPU profiling in **5 minutes** ‚è±Ô∏è!

## Example

This guide will demonstrate CPU profiling using [`go`](https://golang.org/), but these fundamentals apply to any language. Let's walk through an example of CPU profiling.

### Capturing data

Take the following example of a [go](https://golang.org/) program that has a `main` function, that first calls `iterateLong` which calls `iterate` with 9 billion iterations, and then `iterateShort`, which calls `iterate` with 1 billion iterations.

```go
package main

func main() {
	iterateLong()
	iterateShort()
}

func iterateLong() {
	iterate(9_000_000_000)
}

func iterateShort() {
	iterate(1_000_000_000)
}

func iterate(iterations int) {
	for i := 0; i < iterations; i++ {
	}
}
```

When executed this program takes 5 seconds to execute in total (on an AMD Ryzen 5 3400GE CPU). With profiling we can understand _what_ was executing during those 5 seconds and for how long. For the sake of simplicity, a sampling CPU profiler looks at the "current" stack trace 100x per second (the sampling rate is typically configurable, but 100x is both common and easier to calculate with).

### Data format

With a profiler running during the execution of the above program it records a profile, that produces the following data in folded stack trace format:

```txt
main;iterateLong;iterate 450
main;iterateShort;iterate 50
```

> Parca uses the open standard [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof), which is optimized to use as little space as possible, but folded stack traces are great for human readability.

10% (50 samples observed out of 500) of the time was spent in the `iterate` function called by `iterateShort` and 90% (450 samples observed out of 500) of the time was spent in the `iterate` function called by `iterateLong`.

### Visualizing

Using this data, a popular way to visualize profiling data is using Flame Graphs, or as they are called when they are built from the top being the root, Icicle Graphs.

## Recap

In this guide you have learned the basic fundamentals of CPU profiling:

1. How data is captured: by observing the executed stack traces 100x per second.
2. What the raw data looks like: folded stack traces, and the optimized [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) format.
3. Useful ways to visualize data: Flamegraphs/Icicle-Graphs.
