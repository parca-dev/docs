# Resource Usage

Parca retains profile samples in memory and rotates the in-memory block out 
when it reaches a certain size in bytes based on configuration settings.

# Recommended resources

We recommend a rule of thumb of 60 bytes of memory for each sample.
By default the Parca-Agent profiles each core at 19Hz, which means you can expect 
Parca to require 60 bytes * 19 * number of cores. So if you were profiling a 100 cores at a time
you'd expect Parca to ingest 114Kb/s.

## Flags to adjust the active memory footprint

|           Flag            |     Usage                      |       
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `--storage-granule-size`  | By increasing the granule size you'll decrease nominal memory footprint but increase memory usage during compaction. |
| `--storage-active-memory` | Adjust the number of bytes held in memory before being rotated out. This is the easiest way to adjust Parca's memory footprint. |
| `--storage-row-group-size`| Smaller row groups increase memory footprint but increase query speed. Increasing row group size results in lower memory usage but slower queries. |
